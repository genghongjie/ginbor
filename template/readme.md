# ginbro/template folder description

## Why do I put these template file in this fold
these files are original from template project go files which need to replace import package name

## How does the folder come from
generated by the command `ginbro template` the the boilerplate project as source.

## Notice
Do not manually change the `*.tpl`
The only recommended method to edit the `.tpl` is through bolilerplate project then run `ginbro template`
